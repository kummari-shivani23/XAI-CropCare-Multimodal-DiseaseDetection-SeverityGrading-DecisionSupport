XAI-CropCare: An Explainable Multimodal Deep Learning Framework for Crop Disease Detection, Severity Grading, and Decision Support

Overview

XAI-CropCare is a comprehensive deep learning framework designed for modern agriculture. It integrates multimodal data (images and additional metadata) to accurately detect crop diseases, assess severity levels, and provide actionable decision support for farmers and agronomists. The framework also incorporates Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to make the predictions interpretable and transparent.

Key features:

Severity grading of detected diseases for better treatment prioritization.

Decision support module for actionable recommendations.

Explainable AI visualizations to interpret model predictions.
